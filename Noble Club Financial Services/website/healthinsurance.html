                                Why do I need health insurance?
                            </h2>

                        <p> It is important to improve and maintain our health conditions, that’s why we provide for individual and family health insurance, group and small business health insurance. We will help you evaluate different competitive companies and coverages that offer you the most suitable plan for you and your family.<br>

                            <h3>HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)</h3><br>
                            HMO members will be required to choose a PCP (Primary Care Physician) from the HMO network, and pays a nominal co-payment fee on each visit, while the rest is covered by the insurance. An advantage in HMO is that there are no individual or family deductibles.<br>
                            <h3>PPO (Prefered Provider Organization)</h3><br>
                            PPO members are not required to choose their physician or hospital that is limited to the PPO network (although it is usually more cost effective to choose under the network), which proves why PPO has the most flexibility when it comes to choosing physicians. Members may also visit any specialist without the recommendation from their primary care physician. The disadvantage of PPO is that it will require its members to meet an individual or family deductible and may sometimes pay more on nominal co-payments when compared to HMO.<br>
                            <h3>EPO (Exclusive Provider Organization)</h3><br>
                            EPO is very similar to PPO. Like PPO, EPO members may visit any specialist without being referred by their primary physician. The major difference is that the EPO network is much more restrictive when compared to the PPO network, and the coverages for physicians outside of the network will be much less. However, the greatest advantage of EPO is that it will offer significantly lower rates for payments when used under its network.<br>
